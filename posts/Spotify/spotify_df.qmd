Let's analyze the `Spotify` data:

```{py}
import pandas as pd
spotify = pd.read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/spotify_all.csv')
spotify

```
[]
My favorite artist is Miranda Lambert, lets see which of her songs are in this dataframe.
```{py}
_mir = (
    spotify[spotify['artist_name']=='Miranda Lambert'] #sort out my FAV artist
    .drop_duplicates(subset=['track_name']) # list each track only once, as it may be in multiple playlists
    )
_mir[["artist_name", 'track_name']] # list only artist name and track, rest is gibberish
```
[]
Lets see what song in this dateframe has the longest runtime. 

```{py}
spotify.sort_values('duration_ms', ascending= False)[:1]

```
[]
Lets see what the average length of one of Miranda Lamberts songs is.

```{py}
ave = _mir['duration_ms'].mean().round()

ave

```
[]
Lets see how many songs by Miranda Lambert have a shorter runtime than the average we found above of 210422 milliseconds.

```{py}
_mir.query(f"duration_ms < {ave}")

```
